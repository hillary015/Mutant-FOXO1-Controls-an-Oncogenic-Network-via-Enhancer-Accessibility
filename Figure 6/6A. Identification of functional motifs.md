# 6A. Identification of functional motifs
The following code was used to identify functional motifs in bash.

## Merge downregulated ATAC peaks, downregulated eRNA, and bound FKH motifs
Downregulated ATAC peaks, downregulated eRNA, and bound FKH motifs were merged using HOMER in bash. 
```

```

## Merge bound motifs with all ATAC-seq peaks
Bound FKH motifs and all ATAC-seq peaks were merged using HOMER in bash.
```
